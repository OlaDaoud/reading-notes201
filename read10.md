### EXECUTION CONTEXT & HOISTING 
Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity: 
1. Prepare
2. Execute 

* *Hoisting* : 
- Call functions before they have been declared
- Assign a value to a variable that has not yet been
declared

* track every statement to debug your script.
* handle the errors: Try to narrow the problem where might be to ease tracking it.


**Debugging**  is the process of finding errors. 
**The console** helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
