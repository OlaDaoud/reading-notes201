### Domain modeling

* Since you'll be modeling the popularity of many types of videos—parkour epic fails, corgi epic fails, etc.—you'll want to build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
* A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.
