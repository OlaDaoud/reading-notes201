# Images

#### Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images

* There are two ways to align images:
 1. the float property is added to the class that was created.
 2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right.


* In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.

* By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

We have something called background-repeat and it can have four values:
1. **repeat** : image is repeated horizontally and vertically.
2. **repeat-x**:image is repeated horizontally only. 
3. **repeat-y** : image is repeated vertically only. 
4. **no-repeat**

#### If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.
